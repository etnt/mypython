Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm

This implementation demonstrates Shamir's Secret Sharing, a cryptographic algorithm
designed by Adi Shamir. It allows a secret to be divided into n parts (shares),
with a threshold of k parts required to reconstruct the secret.

How it works:
1. Secret Splitting (generate_shares function):
   - Choose a prime number p larger than the secret and the number of shares.
   - Create a polynomial of degree (k-1) where:
     * The constant term is the secret.
     * Other coefficients are random numbers between 1 and p-1.
   - Generate n points on this polynomial to create the shares.
   - All calculations are done in a finite field of integers modulo p.

2. Secret Reconstruction (reconstruct_secret function):
   - Use Lagrange interpolation to reconstruct the polynomial.
   - The constant term of this polynomial is the secret.
   - This works because any k points uniquely determine a polynomial of degree (k-1).

Security:
- With fewer than k shares, the secret cannot be reconstructed.
- The system is information-theoretically secure: fewer than k shares provide
  no information about the secret.

Use cases:
- Distributed key management
- Access control systems
- Secure multi-party computation
